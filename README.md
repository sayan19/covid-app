This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `The Software Composition`
The app was done in react and coded in Java. along with integration of Google Firebase and Google Map API key

### `The Project`
The project was built by me and Rahul. Given the liited amount of time we had due to multiple team changes, we did not get enough time to fully complete the app but pretty confident that if we had 2 weeks then we could have easily built it out. Currently our map comprises of Google Maps integration along with gmail login and information gets stored in the firebase. With more time we could have implemented the Q&A symptom form and the admin dashboard using react. 

### `What will you be seeing`
1) Homepage
2) Symptom Check Form
3) Testing Location Map
4) Sign in Form
5) Admin Dashboard(Not implemented)
### `The Breakdown`
There was multi step planning process inorder to build this application. The first step towards building this application was thinking about the homepage. The homepage consists of the testing locations and the testing questioniaire. On the top there is the sign in page that is linked to the firebase where the user input data gets stored. The user is allowed to either use google account to sign in or the user needs to create an account and that account could be used to sign in. The over arching goal here was to have the user sign in first and then let the user complete the questionare form which would be stored in the admin dashboard beside the name of the users. The user also can see the Covid-19 test locations on campus to provide an easy and hassle free user experience and have everything within the same app. The administration dashboard though not implemeted because of time would ideally allow admins to login and check each user entry along with the symptom form that was filled bu various users against their names. 

### `The Learning`
Overall in the limited time we had I really enjoyed building the application from scratch. Spending time on ideation and trying to figure out how the application would look to completely learning a new pregramimg language React for web development and learning more about firebases this project has defintely had a huge learning curve in limited time frame.
